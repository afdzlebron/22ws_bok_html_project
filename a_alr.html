                    The concept of arousal goes back to the classic work of Moruzzi & Magoun (1949) on the
                    role of the brain stem reticular system in maintaining alertness (Figure 1, for macaque
                    brain).

                        As more became known of the neuromodulatory systems of the brain stem and
                        thalamus, it was necessary to qualify the general concept of arousal into more differentiated
                        components. Within cognitive psychology, a major emphasis has been on producing and
                        maintaining optimal vigilance and performance during tasks; this is the sense of alertness
                        that we discussed in our 1990 article.

                        One approach to the study of alerting is to use a warning signal prior to a target event to
                        produce a phasic change in alertness. The warning cue leads to replacing the resting state
                        with a new state that involves preparation for detecting and responding to an expected
                        signal. If a speeded response is required to the target, reaction time improves following a
                        warning. This improvement is not due to the buildup of more accurate information about the
                        target, which is not changed by the warning signal, but the warning signal does change the
                        speed of orienting attention and thus responding to the signal.

                    <p>
                        Several other methods have been used to study tonic alertness. These include changes over
                        the course of the day (circadian rhythm). Reaction times are usually longer in the early
                        morning and decline over the course of the day only to rise again during the night and peak
                        in the early morning (Posner 1975). These measures reflect other diurnal changes such as
                        body temperature and cortisol secretion. A long established approach to tonic alertness is to
                        use a long and usually rather boring task to measure sustained vigilance. Some of these tasks
                        have grown out of the job of radar operators looking for near-threshold changes over long
                        periods of time. Vigilance tasks rely heavily on mechanisms of the right cerebral cortex
                        (Posner & Petersen 1990). Both classical lesion data and more recent imaging data confirm
                        that tonic alertness is heavily lateralized to the right hemisphere.

                <p>
                    Our understanding of the physiology and pharmacology underlying the alerting system has
                    changed significantly. For example, strong evidence relates the neuromodulator
                    norepinephrine (NE) to the alerting system. A warning signal is accompanied by activity in
                    the locus coeruleus, the source of NE (Aston-Jones & Cohen 2005). Warning-signal effects
                    can be blocked by drugs such as guanfacine and clonodine, which decrease NE release
                    (Marrocco & Davidson 1998). Drugs that increase NE release can also enhance the warning-
                    signal effect. The NE pathway includes major nodes in the frontal cortex and in parietal
                    areas relating to the dorsal but not the ventral visual pathways (Morrison & Foote 1986).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To examine the specificity of these effects to the warning signal, researchers used a cued
                    detection task with humans, monkeys, and rats (Beane & Marrocco 2004, Marrocco &
                    Davidson 1998) to separate information about where a target will occur (orienting) from
                    when it will occur (alerting). To accomplish this, one of four cue conditions was presented
                    prior to a target for a rapid response. By subtracting a double cue condition, where the
                    participant is informed of when a target will occur but not where, from a no cue condition,
                    they receive a specific measure of the warning influence of the signal. When the cue that
                    indicates the targetâ€™s location is subtracted from an alerting cue, the difference represents
                    effects of orienting. Results of drug studies with humans and monkeys show that NE release
                    influences alerting effects, whereas drugs influencing the neuromodulator acetylcholine
                    (Ach) affect orienting but not alerting. Studies have shown that individual differences in
                    alerting and orienting are largely uncorrelated (Fan et al. 2002) and that orienting improves
                    to the same degree with a cue regardless of the level of alertness. These results suggest a
                    great deal of independence between these two functions (Fernandez-Duque & Posner 1997).
                    However, these systems usually work together in most real-world situations, when a single
                    event often provides information on both when and where a target will occur (Fan et al.
                    2009).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The changes during the time between warning and target reflect a suppression of ongoing
                    activity thought to prepare the system for a rapid response. In the central nervous system
                    there is a negative shift in scalp-recorded EEG, known as the contingent negative variation
                    (CNV) (Walter 1964), which often begins with the warning signal and may remain present
                    until the target presentation. This negative potential appears to arise in part from the anterior
                    cingulate and adjacent structures (Nagai et al. 2004) and may overlap the event-related
                    response to the warning stimulus. The negative shift may remain present as a standing wave
                    over the parietal area of the contralateral hemisphere (Harter & Guido 1980). If the target
                    interval is predictable, the person may not show the CNV until just prior to target
                    presentation.

                    An extensive imaging study (Sturm & Willmes 2001) showed that a largely common right
                    hemisphere and thalamic set of areas are involved in both phasic and tonic alerting. Another
                    imaging study, however, suggested that the warning signal effects rely more strongly on left
                    cerebral hemisphere mechanisms (Coull et al. 2000, Fan et al. 2005). This could represent
                    the common findings described above on hemispheric differences in which right lateralized
                    processes often involve slower effects (tonic), whereas left hemisphere mechanisms are more likely
                    to be involved with higher temporal (phasic) or spatial frequencies (Ivry &
                    Robertson 1997). The exact reasons for differences in laterality found with tonic and phasic
                    studies are still unknown.
