                    The orienting network is focused on the ability to prioritize sensory input by selecting a
                    modality or location. Although the arguments in the original review included discussion of
                    the pulvinar and the superior colliculus, most of our focus was on visual selection and on the
                    parietal cortex as part of a posterior attention system (Figure 2
                    a). Consensus in the imaging literature now indicates that frontal as well as posterior areas are
                    involved in orienting. For
                    example, human and animal studies have implicated the frontal eye fields (FEF) in this
                    process (Corbetta et al. 1998, Thompson et al. 2005).

                            (FEF)
                            and the intraparietal sulcus/superior parietal lobe (IPS/SPL). The ventral attention network
                            (teal) consists of regions in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the ventral frontal
                            cortex
                            (VFC). (b) Two networks of the executive control system. The circled region indicates the

                            addition of the frontoparietal system (yellow) (adapted from Dosenbach et al. 2007). (c)

                            These
                            separable resting networks are consistent with the distinctions based on functional criteria
                            exhibited in panels a and b: dorsal attention (green), ventral attention (teal),
                            cingulo-opercular (black), frontoparietal (yellow) (adapted from Power et al. 2011).

                    In addition, parietal areas have been implicated in related forms of processing. This
                    processing can be concrete as in the specification of directed motor or eye movements
                    (Lindner et al. 2010) or more abstract as “movements” across a number line (Hubbard et al.
                    2005). In fact, the specificity of parietal regions in terms of sensory versus motor processing
                    is a major point of contention. Nonetheless, most would agree the functions of the parietal
                    lobe are not restricted to orienting to sensory stimuli but involve other related processes.

            <h2>Elaboration of the Framework</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    In a series of imaging experiments using cuing methodology in combination with event-
                    related fMRI, Corbetta & Shulman (2002) showed that two brain systems are related to
                    orienting to external stimuli as illustrated in Figure 2
                    a. A more dorsal system including the FEFs and the interparietal sulcus followed presentation of an
                    arrow cue and was identified
                    with rapid strategic control over attention. When the target was miscued, subjects had to
                    break their focus of attention on the cued location and switch to the target location. The
                    switch appeared to involve the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the ventral frontal cortex
                    and was identified with the interrupt signal that allowed the switch to occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dorsal system included the well-studied parietal regions but added a small set of frontal
                    locations as well, particularly in the FEFs. Some have argued that covert attention shifts are
                    slaved to the saccadic eye movement system (Rizzolatti et al. 1987), and neuroimaging
                    studies using fMRI have shown that covert and overt shifts of attention involve similar areas
                    (Corbetta et al. 1998). However, single-unit physiology studies in the macaque suggest
                    important distinctions at the level of cell populations, with some cells in the FEFs active
                    during saccades and a distinct but overlapping population of cells involved in covert shifts
                    of attention (Schafer & Moore 2007, Thompson et al. 2005). The cells responsible for covert
                    shifts of attention also seem to hold the location of cues during a delay interval (Armstrong
                    et al. 2009). The two populations of cells are mixed within the FEFs and, at least to date,
                    have not been distinguished by fMRI. However, the physiological data indicate that covert
                    attention is distinct from the motor system governing saccades, even though they clearly
                    interact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As suggested by the FEF studies, it is important to be able to link the imaging and
                    physiological results with other studies to provide more details on local computations. One
                    strategy for doing so is to study the pharmacology of each of the attention networks.
                    Cholinergic systems arising in the basal forebrain appear to play a critical role in orienting;
                    lesions of the basal forebrain in monkeys interfere with orienting attention (Voytko et al.
                    1994). However, it appears that the site of this effect is not in the basal forebrain per se, but
                    instead involves the superior parietal lobe. Davidson & Marrocco (2000) made injections of
                    scopolamine directly into the lateral intraparietal area of monkeys. This area corresponds to
                    the human superior parietal lobe and contains cells influenced by cues about spatial location.
                    The injections have a large effect on the monkey’s ability to shift attention to a target.
                    Systemic injections of scopolamine, an anticholinergic, have a smaller effect on covert
                    orienting of attention than do local injections in the parietal area. Cholinergic drugs do not
                    affect the ability of a warning signal to improve the monkey’s performance, so there appears
                    to be a double dissociation, with NE involved mainly in the alerting network and Ach
                    involved in the orienting network. These observations in the monkey have been confirmed
                    by similar studies in the rat (Everitt & Robbins 1997). It is especially significant that
                    comparisons in the rat studies of cholinergic and dopaminergic mechanisms have shown that
                    only the former influence the orienting response (Everitt & Robbins 1997, Stewart et al.
                    2001).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more ventral network including the TPJ (Figure 2
                    a)
                    seemed to be more active following
                    the target and was thus identified as part of a network responsive to sensory events. It is
                    strongly right lateralized and lesions in this area are central to the neglect syndrome,
                    although the interaction of TPJ with more frontal and dorsal brain areas is also critical
                    (Shulman & Corbetta 2012). Researchers generally agree about the membership of the major nodes of
                    the orienting network on the basis of both spatial cuing and visual search studies
                    (Hillyard et al. 2004, Wright & Ward 2008).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps more surprising is that the brain areas involved in orienting to visual stimuli seem to
                    overlap strongly (within fMRI resolution) with those involved with orienting to stimuli in
                    other modalities (Driver et al. 2004). Although attention operates on sensory-specific
                    modalities according to the incoming target, the sources of this effect appear to be common.
                    There are also important synergies between modalities. In many cases, orienting to a
                    location will provide priority not only to the expected modality but also to information
                    present at the same location from other modalities (Driver et al. 2004), indicating how
                    closely the sensory systems are integrated within the orienting network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can the sources of the orienting network described above influence sensory
                    computations? Anatomically, the source of the orienting effect lies in the network of
                    parietal, frontal, and subcortical areas mentioned above. However, the influence of attention
                    is on the bottom-up signals arriving in sensory-specific areas: for vision, in the primary
                    visual cortex and extrastriate areas moving forward toward the temporal lobe. That this
                    remote influence involves synchronization between activity in the more dorsal attention
                    areas and activity in the more ventral visual areas is an influential idea (Womelsdorf et al.
                    2007). The synchronization apparently leads to greater sensitivity in the visual system,
                    allowing faster responses to visual targets and thus improved priority for processing targets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to synchronization, single-unit physiology studies conducted within ventral
                    visual areas suggest that as items are added to a visual scene they tend to reduce the firing
                    rate of cells responding to the target stimulus. Attention to a target seems to reduce the
                    influence of other competing stimuli. This idea was important in the development of biased
                    competition theory (Desimone & Duncan 1995). This theory sees attention as arising out of
                    a winner-take-all competition within various levels of sensory and association systems.
                    fMRI studies confirm that attention to a stimulus can occur prior to its arrival, changing the
                    baseline neural and blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) response, and that the overall
                    BOLD activity is affected in ways consistent with the biased competition theory (Desimone
                    & Duncan 1995).
