                    Twenty years ago, when neuroimaging was in its infancy, Posner & Petersen (1990) summarized the
                    current state of knowledge
                    on attention in the the Annual Review of Neuroscience. At
                    that time, most available evidence was from behavioral studies of normal adults or patients with
                    varying forms of brain injury. However, the ability to image brain activity with positron emission
                    tomography seemed to hold great promise for the physiological analysis of mental processes,
                    including attention. In our review, we were able to integrate findings of the initial imaging
                    studies. We never imagined that the growth of cognitive neuroscience over the subsequent 20 years
                    would make it possible to revisit our analysis, with 4,000â€“6,000 imaging papers on attention or
                    cognitive control and nearly 3,500 citations of our original review.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original review suggested three basic concepts about the attention system. The first is that the
                    attention system is anatomically separate from processing systems, which handle incoming stimuli,
                    make decisions, and produce outputs. We emphasized the sources of the attentional influences, not
                    the many processing systems that could be affected by attention. The second concept is that
                    attention utilizes a network of anatomical areas. The third is that these anatomical areas carry out
                    different functions that can be specified in cognitive terms. The most unique aspect of our original
                    article, which separated it from the many excellent summaries of the attention literature appearing
                    in the Annual Review of Neuroscience in the years since, is the discrete anatomical basis of the
                    attention system: divided into three networks, each representing a different set of attentional
                    processes. We believe that these important concepts are still operative. Here, we try to update the
                    framework of our earlier Annual Review article [other summaries are available in Posner (2012a,b)].
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this review, we outline some of the major advances related to our framework that have taken place
                    in the past 20 years. First, we reintroduce the three original networks of the attention system. We
                    examine the nature of these networks and how the ideas related to them have evolved. The second part
                    of the article explores additions to the original conception. Two new networks are proposed with
                    their functional descriptions, and new methods for understanding interactions between them. The
                    third part of the article indicates how the ideas have been extended to related topics, for example,
                    in tying genetic variations to individual differences in network efficiency and in examining the
                    development of attention in childhood.

                    The three networks we described in 1990 included an alerting network, which focused on
                    brain stem arousal systems along with right hemisphere systems related to sustained
                    vigilance; an orienting network focused on, among other regions, parietal cortex; and an
                    executive network, which included midline frontal/anterior cingulate cortex. Each of these
                    networks is explored in the following.
