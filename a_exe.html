        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                In our original article, the third major system was presented under the heading of target
                detection. The main reason for this was not that target detection itself is a major attentional
                process, but that the moment of target detection captures awareness in a very specific way.
                Although it is possible to monitor for targets in many processing streams without too much
                difficulty, the moment of target detection produces interference across the system, slowing
                detection of another target (Duncan 1980). This set of processes is related to the limited
                capacity of the attention system, and to awareness itself, and has often been called focal
                attention. One might think of focal attention as the entry to the conscious state, which may
                involve widespread connections from the midline cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex
                (ACC) (Figure 2
                b) to produce the global work space frequently associated with
                consciousness (Dehaene & Changeux 2011). We associated target detection and awareness
                of the target with the medial frontal cortex and the adjacent ACC. This brain region has been
                highly studied by imaging experiments partly because of its frequent activation.

            <p>
                Although one of us (S.P.) has vacillated significantly on this original idea over the past 20
                years, it seems that the idea is still relevant. One of the reasons is that the ACC and related
                regions have been reliably activated when there is conflict [e.g., a requirement to withhold a
                dominant response to perform a subdominant response (Botvinick et al. 2001)]. The
                argument has been extended to include a role for these areas in the regulation of both
                cognition and emotion (Bush et al. 2000).
            </p>
            <p>
                The most compelling argument for a focal attention explanation comes from the activity
                found in the medial frontal/anterior cingulate in such diverse operations as perception of
                either physical (Rainville et al. 1997) or social (Eisenberger et al. 2003) pain, processing of
                reward (Hampton & O’Doherty 2007), monitoring or resolution of conflict (Botvinick et al.
                2001), error detection (Dehaene et al. 1994), and theory of mind (Kampe et al. 2003). These
                different demands all activate this region, in most cases in conjunction with the anterior
                insula. Some investigators advocate a separate role for the system for each of the
                comparisons above (e.g., as part of a pain or reward system), but, as we argue below, we
                support a more comprehensive view that captures more of the results, including focal
                attention and the regulation of processing networks. Since the original article, this network
                has also taken on an even more extensive role in executive control on the basis of findings
                showing multiple top-down control signals in these regions. This more complex functional
                and anatomical network is discussed in the executive control section below.

        <h2>Elaboration of the Framework</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Our third original network has been elaborated considerably. As noted above, our original
                focus was on midline regions of the medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate. We
                suggested that activity found during the performance of tasks was related to focal attention
                because trial-related activity in these regions was greater for targets than for nontargets, for
                conflict more than for nonconflict trials, and for errors more than for correct trials. We
                argued that such a system might be very useful for producing top-down regulation, thus its
                relationship to executive control. This role of the ACC in top-down control was based on
                rather slim evidence at the time but seems to still seems to be accurate and plays an
                important role in two prominent theories of executive control in the current literature. One
                theory stresses the role of the ACC in monitoring conflict and in relation to lateral frontal
                areas in resolving the conflict (Botvinick et al. 2001, Carter & Krug 2012). A different view
                arguing for two different top-down control networks is based on extensive studies of the
                specific aspects of the ACC during task performance and correlations with other regions at
                rest (Figure 2
                b,c) (Dosenbach et al. 2006, 2007).
            </p>
            <p>
                Support for two separate executive control networks arises from studies designed to discover
                signals related to top-down task control. Such signals might include those related to task
                instructions that are transient at the beginning of a task block (Figure 3). Transient block
                transition signals had been seen in earlier work (Donaldson et al. 2001, Fox et al. 2005,Konishi et
                al. 2001) with many different interpretations. A second type of activity is
                sustained across the trials of the task, putatively related to the maintenance of task
                parameters/top-down control (Figure 3). The third type of signal is related to performance
                feedback; an example of such feedback would be systematic differences between correct and
                incorrect trials (Figure 3).

                        red,
                        and activity related to correct (black) and error (blue) trials (adapted from Dosenbach et
                        al.

                        or receiving performance feedback. The bottom figure shows activity in the left anterior

                        end of the block of trials). MR, magnetic resonance.</figcaption>

            <p>
                Dosenbach et al. (2006) studied 10 different tasks (including visual and auditory words and
                visual objects as stimuli, with many different decision criteria, such as semantic, timing, and
                similarity judgments) searching for evidence of these signal types. Lateral frontal and
                parietal regions appeared to emphasize transient signals at the beginning of blocks, whereas
                medial frontal/cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula also showed sustained
                maintenance signals across task conditions. Although these experiments identified a set of
                regions that could be involved in top-down task level control, they provide no evidence of
                the relationships between regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another experiment (Dosenbach et al. 2007) looked for functional correlations (at rest)
                between regions that showed some or all of these putative control signals, with the idea that
                these “functional connections” may define the systems-level relationships between the
                regions. Lateral frontal and parietal regions that showed primarily start-cue activity
                correlated well with each other (Figure 2
                c). The midline and anterior insular regions that
                showed additional sustained activity also correlated well with each other (Figure 2
                c), but
                these two sets of regions did not correlate strongly with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                These results suggested there are two separable executive control networks. Detailed
                evidence for this view is found in Dosenbach et al. (2008). The frontoparietal network
                appears to be distinct from the orienting network discussed previously, whereas the cingulo-
                opercular network overlaps with the original executive network. If this view is correct, there
                are two relatively separate executive networks. Although the best imaging evidence shows
                that the orienting and frontoparietal executive networks are separate in adulthood, they may
                have a common origin in early development (see Self-Regulation section, below).
            </p>
            <p>
                This breakdown of executive control into two separate networks is anatomically similar to
                an influential idea pertaining to cognitive control (Botvinick et al. 2001, Carter & Krug
                2012). However, this cognitive control view favors a single unified executive system in
                which lateral prefrontal cortex provides top-down control signals, guided by performance-
                monitoring signals generated by midline structures. Although the cognitive control view and
                the ideas shown in Figure 2 are anatomically similar, several specific functional differences
                remain. In the dual network view (Dosenbach et al. 2008), the two executive systems act
                relatively independently in producing top-down control. The cingulo-opercular control
                system shows maintenance across trials and acts as stable background maintenance for task
                performance as a whole. The frontoparietal system, in contrast, showing mostly start-cue
                signals, is thought to relate to task switching and initiation and to adjustments within trials in
                real time. Both the cognitive control view and the dual networks view explain a considerable
                amount of extant data, but we believe there are several reasons to choose the latter
                formulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, lesion studies in both humans and animals seem to indicate separate aspects of control.
                Large lesions of the frontal midline often result in akinetic mutism in which people are
                capable of carrying out goal-directed activities but do not do so. On the other hand, patients
                with more laterally placed lesions, including those in the dorsolateral prefronal cortex
                (DLPFC) often exhibit perseverations with an inability to switch from one set to the other.
                In a compelling set of macaque experiments, Rossi et al. (2007) showed that a complete
                unilateral resection of the DLPFC and an interruption of the corpus callosum resulted in a
                unilateral inability to switch sets but an intact ability to adopt a sustained set, consistent with
                the human lesion data.
            </p>
            <p>
                A second difference between the dual network and cognitive control views is concerned
                with the directionality of relationships. The cognitive control view requires a timing
                difference between the midline monitoring processes and the DLPFC implementation
                regions within a trial. The two-network account is tolerant of ordering effects because the
                two networks operate separately. Two quite different sets of data argue that cingulo-
                opercular involvement is often at the end of or after the trial. The first is from studies of
                single-unit activity in the ACC in macaques (Ito et al. 2003). During a saccade
                countermanding task, investigators found neurons that signaled errors and unexpected
                rewards after trial completion. Second, a recent human imaging study by Ploran et al. (2007)
                used a slow reveal task. During visual information processing, activity progressively
                increased with increasing visual information across several seconds in the DLPFC. This
                preceded late activity in the ACC and anterior insula. These results are consistent with the
                hypothesis that the ACC may often serve to monitor the consequences of actions, and they
                are inconsistent with a more rigid directionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The addition of two separate orienting networks and two separate executive networks raises
                the possibility that additional control networks will be elaborated in the future. However, for
                several reasons, we do not expect the number of control networks to be much larger than the
                number described here. The study of many complex systems, from ecosystems to protein-
                protein interactions, seems to indicate that these systems follow a “rule of hand” and have
                approximately five controlling variables (ranging from three to seven) (Gunderson &
                Holling 2002). For example, the maintenance of upright balanced posture appears to be
                controlled by at least three separate systems: vision, the vestibular system, and kinesthetic
                joint sensors. These systems act relatively independently and have different spatial and
                temporal characteristics. From this perspective, the presence of five relatively separate
                attention networks appears reasonable. A second argument in favor of this view is an
                empirical one. In a recent large-scale study of resting state networks (Power et al. 2011),
                with effectively all the brain represented, all the cortical networks, found by the more
                piecemeal approaches described above, are present.
