                    One of the gratifying outcomes of our original publication has been the many ways that
                    these ideas inspired a large number of studies. We review extensions of the framework into
                    new areas related to attention networks.

                <h2>Self-Regulation</h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to control our thoughts, feelings, and behavior in developmental psychology is
                    called self-regulation; with adults it is often called self-control (see sidebar on Will, Self-
                    Regulation, and Self-Control for further definitions). Neuroimaging presents strong evidence
                    that conflict tasks such as the Stroop effect activate common areas of the anterior cingulate
                    gyrus: the dorsal portion for more strictly cognitive tasks and the ventral area for emotion-
                    related tasks (Botvinick et al. 2001, Bush et al. 2000). Although the cingulate anatomy is
                    much more complex, the division into cognitive and emotion-related areas has been
                    supported by more detailed anatomical studies (Beckmann et al. 2009).
                </p>
                <h2>WILL, SELF-REGULATION, AND SELF-CONTROL</h2>
                <p>
                    Several names have been applied to the voluntary control of emotion and cognition.
                    During child development, these functions are often called self-regulation. This name provides a
                    clear contrast to the regulation that occurs through the caregiver or other
                    external sources. In adults, the same set of voluntary functions is frequently called self-
                    control. Regulation may also occur through nonvoluntary means, for example, by fear or
                    by the calming aspects of drugs or therapy. In all cases, self-control or self-regulation
                    appears to be an ability to control reflexive or otherwise dominant responses to select less
                    dominant ones.
                </p>
                <h3>Conflict tasks</h3>
                <p>
                    The Stroop effect involves the conflict between the task of naming the color of ink of
                    conflicting color names (e.g., the word GREEN presented in RED INK). The Stroop and
                    other conflict-related tasks have been used to measure the ability to select the less
                    dominant response. Because the classic Stroop effect requires reading, other conflict
                    tasks such as spatial conflict, flanker conflict, and pictorial conflict have also been used.
                    Imaging studies with adults suggest that the conflict in these tasks have a common
                    anatomy (Fan et al. 2003a).
                </p>
                <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                <p>
                    The use of imaging has provided some evidence of a common brain network that is
                    involved in all these senses of control. This network includes anterior cingulate (Bush et
                    al. 2000) and anterior insula (Dosenbach et al. 2007; Sridharan et al. 2007, 2008) and
                    also includes areas of the prefrontal cortex when inhibition of dominant responses is a
                    strong feature (Fan et al. 2003a). The common involvement of the anterior cingulate in
                    attention and both emotion and cognitive control has provided one basis for the argument
                    that the executive attention network is critical to these various functions. The brain
                    activation of conflict-related tasks such as the Stroop has also been common to studies of
                    attention and aspects of control.
                </p>
                <h3>Age</h3>
                <p>
                    Self-regulation has been a concept used mainly in developmental psychology, whereas
                    the terms cognitive control, self-control, and willpower are usually applied to adults.
                    There appears to be no strict dividing line. A new finding is the important role of the
                    orienting system in providing some of the control in infants and in young children
                    (Posner et al. 2012, Rothbart et al. 2011). Even in adults, no doubt orienting to new
                    sensory stimuli or thoughts can be a self-control mechanism.
                </p>
                <h3>Future</h3>
                <p>
                    The much broader term executive function is applied in psychology to self-control as
                    well as the ability to solve problems, shift tasks, plan ahead, and implement goals.
                    Although conflict resolution has been studied widely with normals, the anatomy of other
                    functions remains to be thoroughly explored.
